ANIMATION LIST
==============

List various animations. Left and Right are assumed to be identical. Frames
per second defaults to 10 if not specified. `frames` defines the animation
sequence. In the example below, cast refers to the 3rd frame in the sequence
not the 3rd frame of the animation. cast is the frame at which the animation
is "locked in". off(set)X and off(set)Y are optional and refer to the pixel
offset with respect to the player's top left corner.
